Data Comparisons

 One of dbUnit's strengths is comparing data -
 table to table, dataset to table, and dataset to dataset.

 dbUnit has two approaches for data comparison:

 [[1]] {{{/datacomparisons/equality.html}equality}} (the original)

 [[1]] {{{/datacomparisons/valuecomparer.html}value comparer}} (since release 2.6.0)
