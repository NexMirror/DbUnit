Equality Comparison

 Since its inception, dbUnit has had equality comparison for expected vs actual
 data results.
 It enables comparing actual table results to expected results in an equal manner.

 The
 {{{/apidocs/org/dbunit/Assertion.html}Assertion}}
 and
 {{{/apidocs/org/dbunit/assertion/DbUnitAssert.html}DbUnitAssert}}
 classes have assertEquals() methods for the equality comparisons.
